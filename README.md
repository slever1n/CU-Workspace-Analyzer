# ClickUp Workspace Analyzer

A Streamlit application that analyzes your ClickUp workspace, generates a company profile using AI, and provides tailored recommendations to improve productivity and organization based on your workspace data, your company's use case, and the generated company profile.

## Features

- **Workspace Analysis:**  
  Fetches and displays metrics (e.g., Spaces, Folders, Lists, Total Tasks, Completed Tasks, Task Completion Rate, Overdue Tasks, High Priority Tasks) from your ClickUp workspace using the ClickUp API.

- **Company Profile Generation:**  
  Uses the Gemini model (specifically `gemini-2.0-flash`) to create a short, structured company profile based on a provided company name. If Gemini is not available, it falls back to OpenAI.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations:**  
  Combines workspace metrics, the company profile, and your described use case to generate actionable recommendations and best practices to optimize your workflow.

- **Useful ClickUp Resources:**  
  Provides direct links to ClickUp Templates, ClickUp University, and the ClickUp Help Center.
